Research

Select any publicly available dataset of your choice. You can use any public repository available, such as data.gov, kaggle, 
or many more (see this site, for example (Links to an external site.)). Try to find a dataset that has the description of the 
columns (or data dictionary available to you). Requirements for your data:
The response variable (or dependent variable) should be numerical continuous
There should be 3 or 4 numerical continuous columns that are likely to be predictive of your response variable
Download the data and analyze each column. Note that is the data is to big, you may not be able to open it in Excel. R can open 
really huge dataset, but has a limit, too.
If your data is too large, you should consider using only a partition of the rows. I don't recommend you go with data that has more 
than 1M rows.


Exploratory Data Analysis

   1. Objective of the Proposed Research: Describe in your own words the objective of the research in 3 paragraphs or more. 
   Who is your stakeholder and how this project will help him/her with their decisions. Your stakeholder can be one person 
   (e.g. the Police Commissioner, Stockton Mayor) or an entity (e.g. Century Fox Entertainment)

   2. Data Exploration: Describe your data with code (and text) depicting at least 4 different aspects of your it.

   3. Data Cleaning: Clean the data, removing rows and columns that have no useful information or no information at all.

   4. Adaptation: Create at least two additional columns that are necessary for your study. They can be calculated columns or 
    aggregated columns.

Visualization

   5. Descriptive Visualization: Create a few (at least 4) distinct relevant static visualizations that show different aspects of 
   the data. Two visualizations of the same kind (e.g. two scatter plots) are not considered distinct. You can use any of the libraries 
   or examples covered in class, or you can research your own examples.

Linear Regression

Run linear regression models on your data against your pre-selected response variable.

  6. Explore Correlations: Create plots that explain the correlation between your variables, specifically concentrating on your 
  exploratory variable

   7. Response Variable: Explain your numerical continuous response variable. What does it represent? Why did you select that variable?
   What are you expecting to find?

   8. Simple Linear Regression:Make 5 models of simple linear regression to try and make predictions. 
   Try to answer questions such as: "How well can temperatures predict the weekly sales?". Interpret the results of each model 
   with explanatory text. Compare your models and select the best one.

   9. Multiple Linear Regression: Try now to, again, predict the weekly sales, but using more than one variable. 
   Try different scenarios, compare your models and pick the best. Explain in words the interpretation of each of your models. Compare the multiple regression result with the simple regression result.

Findings

   10. Project Report: write a formal report to your stakeholders with the summary of your report with 10 paragraphs and a few plots. 
   Your report should be addressed to your stakeholder and the analysis should be relevant to them.
